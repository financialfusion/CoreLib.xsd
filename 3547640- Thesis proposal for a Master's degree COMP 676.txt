Abstract
The popularity of online learning in higher education has increased significantly, but the high rate of dropout and course failure remains a major concern. Despite the considerable amount of research on student retention and risk prediction, the dropout rate remains high in educational institutions. This research aims to address this issue by developing a personalized model for predicting course failure and dropout in online education. By leveraging log data generated by Learning Management Systems (LMSs), this research aims to develop robust features and tools that can help identify students facing challenges in a course. A literature review examines existing studies on risk factors and personalized risk models in learning management systems, highlighting the importance of factors such as low engagement, poor time management, and demographic variables in predicting student attrition. The methodology involves gathering general risk factors, analyzing the Moodle LMS database, identifying personal student behaviors, applying statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, and consulting experts. Statistical analysis techniques will be employed to identify potential risk factors, which will be used to create a generalized at-risk model. Furthermore, machine learning approaches will be utilized to train a personalized individual risk model. The research will culminate in the development of a user-friendly Moodle plugin that integrates the personalized risk model, assisting educators in identifying at-risk students and providing timely support to mitigate dropout rates. This research will significantly contribute to the state-of-the-art personalized prediction methods in education, offering a more personalized approach that fosters a supportive environment for students' success. The success of students in completing their programs has both individual and societal benefits, including financial advantages for students and a better-trained workforce for the economy.


Introduction
In the field of education, identifying and supporting at-risk students is of paramount importance. Early detection of students who are at risk of academic underachievement or dropping out can enable timely interventions and personalized support, leading to improved educational outcomes. With the increasing availability of data and advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, there is a growing opportunity to develop effective risk prediction models that can assist educators in identifying at-risk students and implementing targeted interventions.
This research proposal aims to address the challenges associated with student risk prediction and identification by leveraging data analytics, machine learning, and AI algorithms. The primary objective is to develop accurate and reliable models that can predict student risk factors based on various indicators such as academic performance, engagement, behavior, and socio-demographic characteristics. By identifying these risk factors, educators can intervene early and provide appropriate support to mitigate potential negative outcomes.
The proposed research will build upon existing literature on student risk prediction and identification methods, particularly focusing on the use of AI and personalization techniques. A comprehensive literature review will be conducted to identify effective risk factors associated with student outcomes and explore the diverse range of machine learning and AI algorithms used in this domain. This review will provide a foundation for refining the research questions and objectives, allowing for the development of robust risk prediction models.
Furthermore, this research aims to compare different machine learning and AI algorithms to determine their effectiveness in predicting student risk. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of these algorithms, educators and researchers can make informed decisions about selecting the most suitable approaches for their specific contexts. Additionally, the research will contribute to the development of ethical guidelines and best practices for data usage, ensuring the protection of student privacy and the responsible handling of sensitive information.
The anticipated outcomes of this research include the development of accurate risk prediction models, the identification of effective risk factors, the comparison of machine learning and AI algorithms, the creation of generalized and personalized risk prediction models, the evaluation of a Moodle plugin for identifying at-risk students, and the dissemination of research findings through publications and conferences. These outcomes will provide valuable insights and practical implications for educators, policymakers, and researchers, ultimately leading to improved educational practices and better support for at-risk students.
Overall, this research proposal seeks to contribute to the field of student risk prediction and identification by leveraging data analytics and advanced algorithms. By addressing the research gaps and developing innovative approaches, this study aims to enhance our understanding of student risk factors and provide valuable tools for educators to intervene proactively and improve educational outcomes for at-risk students.
